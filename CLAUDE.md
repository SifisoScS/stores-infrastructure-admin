# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Flask-based web application called "Derivco Stores Infrastructure Administration" that provides a comprehensive inventory management system for Derivco's Durban facilities. The system features a dual architecture with both a legacy application (`app.py`) and an enhanced version (`enhanced_app.py`) with advanced Python backend services, transforming it from a 19.4% Python codebase to 60%+ Python implementation.

## Common Development Commands

### Running Applications
**Legacy Application:**
```bash
python app.py
```

**Enhanced Application (Recommended):**
```bash
python enhanced_app.py
```

Both applications start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### VS Code Development
- Press `F5` to start debugging with "Flask App" configuration (legacy app)
- Enhanced app debugging: Run `enhanced_app.py` directly or modify launch.json
- Additional debug configurations:
  - "Analyze Excel" - Excel structure analysis utility
  - "Add Sample Data" - Sample data generation tool

### Dependencies
Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Core packages:
- Flask 3.0.3 (web framework)
- pandas 2.2.3 (data processing)
- openpyxl 3.1.5 (Excel integration)
- numpy 2.1.3 (numerical operations)
- qrcode 8.2.0 (QR code generation)
- Pillow 11.3.0 (image processing)
- flask-cors (enhanced app CORS support)

## Architecture Overview

### Dual Application Structure

- Simple Excel integration through dedicated modules
- Template filtering and QR code generation functionality

**Enhanced Application (`enhanced_app.py`)**
- Advanced Python backend with enterprise services
- Comprehensive analytics engine and real-time compliance monitoring
- Advanced Excel processing with error handling
- Configuration-driven development with environment support

### Backend Services Architecture

**Core Layer (`core/`):**
- `excel_processor.py` - Advanced Excel processing with validation and error handling

**Services Layer (`services/`):**

- Category-specific inventory (Electric, Plumbing, Carpentry, Painting, Aircon, etc.)
- Maintenance Log
- Suppliers & Contractors
- Medical Incidents
- Access Control items

### API Endpoints Structure
- `GET /` - Home page with all services
- `GET /inventory` - Inventory dashboard
- `GET /category/<name>` - Category detail views
- `GET /signout-register` - Sign-out register interface
- `GET /medical-services` - Medical services dashboard
- `GET /api/*` - JSON API endpoints for all data
- `POST /api/reload-data` - Refresh data from Excel sources

## Development Patterns

### Working with Dual Architecture
- **For new features**: Prefer developing in the enhanced application (`enhanced_app.py`)
- **Legacy maintenance**: Use `app.py` for backward compatibility
- **Configuration-driven**: Use `config.py` for environment-specific settings

### Adding New Inventory Categories
**Enhanced Application:**
1. Add new sheet to enhanced Excel file with standardized columns
2. Update `core/excel_processor.py` for advanced data processing
3. Extend `services/inventory_service.py` for business logic
4. Add appropriate icon mapping in template filters
5. Create or update category detail templates

**Legacy Application:**
1. Add new sheet to Excel file with standardized columns
2. Update `data_loader.py` sheet processing logic
3. Add appropriate icon mapping in `app.py` template filters
4. Create or update category detail templates

### Excel Integration Patterns
**Enhanced Processing (`core/excel_processor.py`):**
- Advanced validation with detailed error reporting
- Transaction-safe data updates
- Automatic backup creation
- Schema validation and type checking

**Legacy Processing (`data_loader.py`):**
- Basic pandas/openpyxl data loading
- Simple error handling
- Direct data access methods
- Manual data reloading

### Template Organization
- Base template provides common navigation and styling
- Feature-specific templates extend base template
- Responsive design with Bootstrap/custom CSS
- Font Awesome icons for UI elements
